# SageMaker for Image Classification

We provide pretrained model using SageMaker Image Classification algorithm and you can deploy this model in SageMaker Endpoint. However, this model was trained using small amount of training data set.
If you want to train using your own training dataset, we provide sample notebook with image augmentation process and hyperparameter tuning.
