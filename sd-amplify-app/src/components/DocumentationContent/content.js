    overview: 'This Smart Document Identification application is a machine learning powered application that is able to identify National ID, Driving License and Passport from 5 countries (Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam). This document identification leverages two methods of classification: image based identification and text based identification. This application is built using AWS Amplify with support from Amazon SageMaker and Amazon Textract works under the hood to classify uploaded images.',

        details:[
            " - Scalable web application with integrated user authentication",
            " - Ability to classify national ID, driving license and passport from 5 countries",
            " - Classify input images based on image classification, this image classification is trained for 3 documents from 5 countries",
            " - Classify input images based on extracted text from those document",
            " - Extract document entities based on specific document type"

    imageclasssification:{
        text:'Image Classification API is using Amazon SageMaker Endpoint hosted SageMaker model pretrained with around 280 training images with 15 classes. This model trained using SageMaker Image Classification algorithm with additional image augmentation process (rotate, sharpen and contrast) applied in this training datasets. Since this application was designed to do real-time image classification, we are using SageMaker instead of Amazon Rekognition Custom Label for cost optimization.'

    textclassification:{
        text:'Document Text Classification leverages Textract API which uses OCR to parse text from image and PDF documents. Textract API reads texts in the identity document and return scanned texts and form values. Document Text Classification endpoints then parses and uses programmatic logic based on unique identity document content to classify country and document type of the parsed document. Document Text Classification returns key-value based form values to list down all identity data within the document.'
